>Your grown up **town**, your old **friends**, your **mom** washing dishes, your **dad** yelling at you, your old **memories**.

> It's the time you have to **move on.** Even though you don't want to, you have no choice but to take **the next step**. Moving on to your next life is scary, but that's something you have to overcome your fears because if you think about it, nothing lasts **forever**.
